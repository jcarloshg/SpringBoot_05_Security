### How read the roles from a Data Base
Also, while I was developed. One thinking arrived into my mind, how I as developer can catch the privileges from any user from a DataBase. This requirement could be resolve by **Spring Security** and **JDBC Code** work together.

I needed to specify what tables with their columns should be used. This task was resolved using **Queries**.
